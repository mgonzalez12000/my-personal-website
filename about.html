          <p style = "color:white">
            I am a computer science student attending California State University, Los Angeles, who is pursuing a bachelors degree. During my time at CSULA, I have dedicated a lot of my owm time to study and learn about the different field of studies for computer science. As a result, I have found interests in software engineering, data science, and web/internet programming. Because of my devotion and hard work, I have found myself to be fortunate enough to find and take part of opportunities to showcaase and test my programming skills.

            <h3>Experience:</h3>
            <p>- XSEDE Data Science Internship (Summer 2020): As an intern, I was responsible to research and gather data towards an appropiate technological approach to decrease gun violence, specifically in Los Angeles, that can be used for future research. I proceeded to access and gather data from police departments across the nation through their databases and CSV files. I used tools such as Jupyter Notebook to parse CSV files and used the IDE RStudio to write code, in Pyhton 3, to analyze and create statistcal graphs. With the help of my mentor, I found that implementing gunshot detection systems to be a good technological approach. This solution was presented at the end of my internship. </p>
            <p>- NASA Data Intensive Research and Education for STEM (August 2019 - March 2020): At NASA DIRECT STEM, I was part of a student-cohort of pre-trainees. I was mentored and trained with professionals from UC Irvine, and JPL in computational physics, cloud computing, and data analysis directly meeting NASA's mission goal and standads. My selected contributions consisted of analyzing and developing two-dimensional and three-dimensional statstical graphs consisting og climate change data. Furthermore, with the contributions from XSEDE and TACC, I also had hands on experience to upload my work to supercomputers and understand their fundamental functions </p>
